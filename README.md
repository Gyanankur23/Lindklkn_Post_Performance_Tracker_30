# Lindklkn_Post_Performance_Tracker_30 CaseCraft Analytics Project Sprint Project 30

## ðŸ’¼ Overview  
This project builds a modular LinkedIn Post Performance Tracker using synthetic engagement data across 30+ project posts. It blends format analysis, timing heatmaps, and domain resonance to optimize future visibility and audience engagement.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective  
To analyze post formats, timing slots, and domain categories to uncover what drives the most likes, comments, shares, and savesâ€”normalized by follower count.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset & Features  
- **Posts**: 35 synthetic entries  
- Features:  
  - `format`: carousel, image, text, link  
  - `domain`: retail, influencer, recommendation, automotive, NLP, finance  
  - `timestamp`, `day`, `hour`  
  - `likes`, `comments`, `shares`, `saves`, `follower_count`  
  - Derived: `total_engagement`, `normalized_likes`

## ðŸ“ˆ Visual Explorations  
- **Bar Chart**: Average engagement by format  
- **Heatmap**: Post frequency by day and hour  
- **Boxplot**: Likes distribution by domain  
- **Histogram**: Total engagement spread  
- **Line Plot**: Weekday-wise engagement trend  
- **Count Plot**: Format distribution  
- **Histogram**: Likes normalized by follower count  
- **Top Posts Table**: Snapshot of top 5 posts by likes

## ðŸ§  Key Insights  
1. **Format Performance**: Carousel posts lead in likes and shares  
2. **Timing Sweet Spot**: Midweek (Tueâ€“Thu) between 11 AMâ€“2 PM shows peak engagement  
3. **Domain Resonance**: Retail, influencer, and recommendation topics perform best  
4. **Normalized Metrics**: Reveal hidden impact beyond raw counts  
5. **Format Balance**: Carousel and image dominate; link posts underused  
6. **Top Posts**: Text and image formats also break through when paired with high-engagement domains

## âœ… Final Conclusion  
The LinkedIn tracker delivers clarity-first insights into post performance. Format, timing, and domain alignment are key drivers of visibility. Carousel posts posted midweek around midday in high-resonance domains yield the strongest engagement. The modular structure supports reuse for future sprints, milestone recaps, and visibility strategy. Fully markdown-separated and deployment-ready for GitHub or Notion integration.
